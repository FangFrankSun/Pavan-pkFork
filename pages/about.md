# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a graduate student at ASU, pursuing MS in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. My current interest lies in the use of AI techniques (planning and learning in specific) to solve real-world problems.<br>
Previous to my graduate studies, I have amassed 5 experience in software engineering at Motorola Mobility across domains such as systems development, android development, web development, scripting, and ML. I have driven software solutions from conception to implementation that supports millions of users on daily basis.
